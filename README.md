# HW0_CMAKE
CMake primer modified from CMake's official tutorial :https://cmake.org/cmake-tutorial/

Used in conjunction with the cmake gui, for the purpose of introducing cmake, basic 
project configuration, and familiarity with some CGL libraries used in CS184.

When built, one should be able to run ./Tutorial a.x a.y b.x b.y to get a projection of b onto a, with each four values being floats (aka, ./Tutorial 0 1 1 1 should return 0 1)
